# Stoic Dashboard chrome extension 

The stoic dashboard app serves as a personalized chrome extension dashboard built with HTML, CSS & async JavaScript.

The dashboard dynamically updates various elements: firstly, it fetches a random landscape-oriented nature photo from Unsplash API and sets it as the background image,providing a visually appealing backdrop. Secondly, it utilizes the Geolocation API to obtain the user's current position and fetches weather data from OpenWeatherMap API, converting the temperature to Celsius and displaying the weather icon, temperature, and city name & it displays the current time. Finally, it fetches a random Stoic quote from the Stoic Quotes API and exhibits it alongside the author, offering inspirational content. 

Altogether, the app combines real-time updates on time and weather with aesthetically pleasing visuals and philosophical insights, creating a comprehensive and engaging personal dashboard experience.
